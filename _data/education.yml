    During my time at John Abbott College I learnt most of basic skills/knowledge on web development. 
    
    Through the assignments and projects, I practiced and accumulated hands-on experience on coding, debugging, toolkits implementing.

    Even little more advanced experience/skills, as implementing web development framework like Angular or ASP.NET CORE to develop complicated projects containing both frontend and backend.
